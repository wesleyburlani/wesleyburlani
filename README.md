>A man from a simple place who founds in science the opportunity to change his life, leaving his home to wander elsewhere, leading to serenity and respecting what music and boxing could bring us. 

Hello guys, I'm Wesley Burlani and I live in Chapec√≥, state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. I'm Computer science student graduating on bacharelor's degree, at least trying.. But despite that I'm a programmer who had worked mostly with C# and .NET core in my career and currently working with Typescript.

At this document I inserted my contacts, feel free to contact me and invite me to great projects or just exchange knowledge :)
