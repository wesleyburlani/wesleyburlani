Hello guys, I'm Wesley Burlani and I live in Chapec√≥, state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. I'm Computer science student graduating on bacharelor's degree, at least trying.. But despite that I'm a programmer who had worked mostly with C# and . NET core in my career and currently working with Typescript.
