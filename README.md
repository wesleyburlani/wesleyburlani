Hello guys, I'm Wesley Burlani and I live in Barueri, state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and I'm a programmer who had worked mostly with C# and . NET core in my career and currently working with Typescript.

At this document I inserted my contacts, feel free to contact me and invite me to great projects or just exchange knowledge :)
